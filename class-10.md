# Class-10 reading Notes

### things thought during reading
* I have come to a realization as my delema with the book it is simpy distracting....
  there seems to be a visual flow issue that makes it activly distracting to my brain thus rendering it vaguely useless to me....
  I have found I only understand any part of it after lecture and the explaiantions given in class.

* i have been slow going back a adding my class notes in leiu of book notes as that is how i have been able to process the information.

* a summery of the summary (the only page i can actualy manage to read all the way through)
  use the console... alot
* js has 7 error types and will tell you where it break by line number

* there is a handeling method called try catch finaly... that will help ease breaks
